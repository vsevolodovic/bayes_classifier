# bayes_classifier
This project is the first assignment of the Istanbul Technical University machine learning master's course numbered BLG527E.
A bayes classifier model was created without using a built-in functions from libraries. My homework grade is 84. So there may be some mistakes. 
You can find detailed information about the project in the Instructions_ML.pdf file. 
For background information about bayes classifier, i suggest you to watch DR.Islem Rekik's Machine Learning lecture videos. Links are given below. 
Thanks to Dr. Ä°slem Rekik and her assistant Dogay Kamar for their contributions.
